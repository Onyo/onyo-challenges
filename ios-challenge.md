### **API** ###

Company list: [http://api.staging.onyo.com/v1/mobile/brand/1/company](http://api.staging.onyo.com/v1/mobile/brand/1/company)

### **Must have** ###

* Customized UINavigationBar
* Company list
* Category list
* Follow design on the provided screenshots.
* Asynchronous and on demand image loading
* Dependency management system (CocoaPods, Gradle, ...)
* Minimum iOS version 8.0
* Swift 2.0

### **Optional, but recommended** ###

* Customized tabs
* API Communication Framework (Alamofire, ...)
* ORM Framework (CoreData, Realm, MagicRecord, ...)
* Image loading and cache Framework (SDWebImage, Alamofire, Fast Image Cache, ...)
* Unit Testing (XCTest, KIF, Kiwi, Quick, ...)
* Functional tests (Appium, UIAutomation, ...)

*The frameworks are just a suggestion. You can use any other frameworks and _surprise us_!*

### **ATENTION** ###

1. You don`t need to worry about the category images height. You can assume that all the images have the same height.
2. You should not try to push changes directly to this repository.

### **Submission Process** ###
The candidate must implement the app and send a Pull Request to this repository with the solution.

The Pull request process works on either of these ways:

1. The candidate forks the repository (should not clone it directly)
2. Works on the code using the forked repository.
3. Commit and push changes to the forked repository.
4. Using the GitHub interface, send the pull request.
5. Notify us by e-mail.

Or if you want some privacy to your code:

1. Create a BitBucket private repository.
2. Commit and push changes to it.
3. Add the user onyo-mobile-team as a collaborator (read-only access is enough).
4. Notify us by e-mail.
